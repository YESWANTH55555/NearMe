Rajahmundry was under Dutch rule for some time. In 1602, the Dutch constructed a fort 
here. In 1857, the British conquered the Dutch. They converted it into a jail in 1864 
and elevated it into a central jail in 1870. The jail is spread over 196 acres (79 ha) 
out of which the buildings occupy 37.24 acres (15.07 ha).

In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajahmundry was created in 1823.
It was reorganised in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Krishna districts. 
During British rule, Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was 
further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari 
district was split, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became 
headquarters of West Godavari.
