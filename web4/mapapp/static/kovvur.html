This Town was earlier referred as Govur.According to Brahma Puranam, 
Kovvur(Govuru) is considered as the place of Gautama Maharishi's Ashramam. 
He did farming in the surrounding regions to maintain his Ashramam. Gautama Maharishi 
once he accidentally kills a cow, grazing in his paddy field, by throwing a darbha 
(sharp, pointed grass). Gautama becomes upset with this incident and offers a great 
tapas for Lord Shiva in Brahmagiri mountains. The god, pleased by his tapas, wipes 
away his sin and allows Ganga to flow in his farm to purify the place (Kovvur). 
The river thus originated is called "Godavari" which means "originated due to killing a 
cow". It is also called as "Gautami" in appreciation to the effort of the Maharishi 
in bringing Godavari to earth. Gautama Maharishi accidentally kills a cow in his farm and 
to clear out his sin, he offers a great tapas near Bhrahmagiri parvatas near 
Triambakam in Maharashtra. Lord Shiva pleased with his tapas allows Ganga to 
sanctify the region.
